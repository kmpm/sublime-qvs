# QlikView Package for Sublime Text
This is a QlikView script syntax package for the wonderful text editor
Sublime Text.


## Installation
Even though this could techincally be used in Linux+Mac as well I see really no big use for it.
QlikView, which is required to actualy make use of the script, is only available on Windows.
Thats why the following instructions are __for Windows only__

### Using Git 
This is the way to go if you wan't to help out developing the package.

* Open a command prompt
* Go to %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages
* git clone git://github.com/kmpm/sublime-qvs.git QlikView
* Restart Sublime Text

### Files only
* Download a zip file of the current code from https://github.com/kmpm/sublime-qvs/zipball/master
* Unzip the files within to %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages\QlikView
* Restart Sublime Text
